Foundry
-------
- Chest Items and their exit object are still handled by manually adding/dragging them around. That's not great. Also,
  what happens, when you add more than one?

- Remove Autoscroll Object, and other "special" objects, whose functionality is configured using the editor from the
  object toolbar, so that users don't add them unnecessarily

- Currently it is not that easy to place a level on the world map, when editing it directly from the ROM, you basically
  need to save it as an M3L, then open it again and *then* place it where you want (right?)


Scribe
------

- Pipes, super complicated, apparently, and probably not easy to make easy to manipulate/understandable


smb3parse
---------
- after implementing Locks, we need to find a way to change the boom boom y position accordingly; we need to do this in
  scribe, because this depends on the world map fortress fx base offset, which we don't (always) have in Foundry

- maybe document the data point classes better, to preserve the knowledge it took to parse them correctly in the first
  place
