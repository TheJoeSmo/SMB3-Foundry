- BoomBoom Lock shenanigans, dependent on upper nibble of its Y-Position, so most BoomBooms are not visible and editing
  them is not really user friendly, maybe make special routine to always display BoomBoom inside level and preserve its
  upper nibble? And then make the lock related edits via Scribe?

- Chest Items and their exit object are still handled by manually adding/dragging them around. That's not great. Also,
  what happens, when you add more than one?

- Remove Autoscroll Object, and other "special" objects, whose functionality is configured using the editor from the
  object toolbar, so that users don't add them unnecessarily

- Currently it is not that easy to place a level on the world map, when editing it directly from the ROM, you basically
  need to save it as an M3L, then open it again and *then* place it where you want (right?)


Scribe
------

- Pipes, super complicated, apparently, and probably not easy to make easy to manipulate/understandable


smb3parse
---------

- maybe document the data point classes better, to preserve the knowledge it took to parse them correctly in the first
  place
