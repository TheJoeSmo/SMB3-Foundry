Foundry
-------
- Show chest items as overlay?

- If a door or Pipe in a level is not in a Jump Zone, it will default to the first jump in the level (object order, or
  screen order?)

- Data Management, on where which level is, is difficult, since the user doesn't know where which levels are and where
  code lies. Is there code in between levels? Can we find address ranges, which can be used to store levels? What about
  expanded Roms?

- Make translatable?

- Make M3Ls instaplayable

Scribe
------
- Export all world data into a file and enable importing it back into a rom (not just the layout, like m3l)

- Add warning to level pointers on row 8, since those are not possible in game.

smb3parse
---------
- maybe document the data point classes better, to preserve the knowledge it took to parse them correctly in the first
  place

- Why are the sprites not part of the world map data point? Makes reordering the worlds kinda weird.
