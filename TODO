- Chest Items and their exit object are still handled by manually adding/dragging them around. That's not great. Also,
  what happens, when you add more than one?

- If a door or Pipe in a level is not in a Jump Zone, it will default to the first jump in the level (object order, or
  screen order?)

- Parse the ASM Macros from Southbirds Disassembly, so you can load levels directly from it (Maybe also export them?)
- Or at least fail gracefully

- Data Management, on where which level is, is difficult, since the user doesn't know where which levels are and where
  code lies. Is there code in between levels? Can we find address ranges, which can be used to store levels? What about
  expanded Roms?

- Edit pipe pairs?

- Make translatable?

Scribe
------
- Change world info when dialog is closed, not immediately so there are less undo commands produced

smb3parse
---------
- maybe document the data point classes better, to preserve the knowledge it took to parse them correctly in the first
  place
