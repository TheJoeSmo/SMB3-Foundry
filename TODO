Foundry
-------
- Chest Items and their exit object are still handled by manually adding/dragging them around. That's not great. Also,
  what happens, when you add more than one?

- Currently it is not that easy to place a level on the world map, when editing it directly from the ROM, you basically
  need to save it as an M3L, then open it again and *then* place it where you want (right?)

- If a door or Pipe in a level is not in a Jump Zone, it will default to the first jump in the level (object order, or
  screen order?)

- Parse the ASM Macros from Southbirds Disassembly, so you can load levels directly from it (Maybe also export them?)


Scribe
------

- Change world info when dialog is closed, not immediately so there are less undo commands produced
- Tooltip with world tile name in tool window


smb3parse
---------
- maybe document the data point classes better, to preserve the knowledge it took to parse them correctly in the first
  place
