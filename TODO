Foundry
-------
- Show chest items as overlay?

- If a door or Pipe in a level is not in a Jump Zone, it will default to the first jump in the level (object order, or
  screen order?)

- Data Management, on where which level is, is difficult, since the user doesn't know where which levels are and where
  code lies. Is there code in between levels? Can we find address ranges, which can be used to store levels? What about
  expanded Roms?

  - Save Level Data Beginning explicitly, instead of using the first level, to make it configurable
  - Fail better, when a level can't be parsed
  - Update manual regarding this feature
  - When parsed, show found levels, instead of Vanilla Levels in level viewer?
  - Don't allow it, when level is not saved?


- Make translatable?

- Make M3Ls instaplayable

- Ask if the map should be scrolled, when using Pipe Pairs.

- Scroll to Jump Zone Position, when editing Jumps

- Rearrange Menus to split Rom and Level configs

- Somehow list the "hidden" levels of Worlds, like CoinShip and Generic Exit


Scribe
------
- Export all world data into a file and enable importing it back into a rom (not just the layout, like m3l)

- Add warning to level pointers on row 8, since those are not possible in game.

smb3parse
---------
- maybe document the data point classes better, to preserve the knowledge it took to parse them correctly in the first
  place

- Why are the sprites not part of the world map data point? Makes reordering the worlds kinda weird.
