Foundry
-------
- Show chest items as overlay?

- Draw Autoscroll objects, like BoomBooms, independent of their true y-position.

- If a door or Pipe in a level is not in a Jump Zone, it will default to the first jump in the level (object order, or
  screen order?)

- Parse the ASM Macros from Southbirds Disassembly, so you can load levels directly from it (Maybe also export them?)
- Or at least fail gracefully

- Data Management, on where which level is, is difficult, since the user doesn't know where which levels are and where
  code lies. Is there code in between levels? Can we find address ranges, which can be used to store levels? What about
  expanded Roms?

- Edit pipe pairs?

- Make translatable?

- Make M3Ls instaplayable

Scribe
------
- Change world info when dialog is closed, not immediately so there are less undo commands produced

- Export all world data into a file and enable importing it back into a rom (not just the layout, like m3l)

- Find a way to make changing screen counts and moving worlds around work without data loss

- Add warning to level pointers on row 8, since those are not possible in game.

smb3parse
---------
- maybe document the data point classes better, to preserve the knowledge it took to parse them correctly in the first
  place
